Proof of concept of reading inputs from a [NintendoSpy](https://github.com/jaburns/NintendoSpy) device via the [Web Serial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Serial). Intended as an exploratory project for functionality that will eventually be added into [gamepad-viewer](https://github.com/everalert/gamepad-viewer), and has no special features whatsoever. It is also hard-coded to read GameCube controller inputs.
